Instructions for making Google maps work on your emulator:

1. Start the emulator
2. Make sure HvZ is uninstalled. On the emulator,
    go to Settings > Applications > Manage applications > HvZ,
    and hit Uninstall
2. Export the HvZ_Activity.apk using Eclipse and the hvz.keystore
    (password is pandaroll)

With the terminal:
3. cd to path/to/android-sdk-macosx/platform-tools
4. do a $ adb devices
    (to verify you have an emulator running)
5. do a $ adb install /path/to/HvZ_Activity.apk

Google maps should now work with the mini map.
