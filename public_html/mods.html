In addition to being one of the many awesome and slightly crazy moderators for Urban Gaming Club, 
Jordan can often be found among the ranks of the Oredigger Newspaper writers or finding new books 
to buy as the Librarian for the Role-Playing Club. She hails from Texas, the greatest state in the Union, 
and although she was raised there, she freely admits that she never actually grew up at any point and 
hence spends much of her time trying to pass her five-year-old self off as an adult. 
She is most known around campus for being "that girl with the orange hat," and is currently engaged 
in an epic fight to the death with Mines in pursuit of a Mechanical Engineering degree.
