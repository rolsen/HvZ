<span class=F3 color=#ff474c>What is HVZ? (A concise description)</span>
<br>
<br>
Humans Vs. Zombies is an extreme, campus-wide game of tag. There are two teams: The Humans and the Zombies. The zombies' 
goal is to eat and infect all the humans, increasing their ranks. The humans' goal is to stay alive until all the 
zombies die of starvation. Zombies can catch humans by tagging them; humans can stun zombies by shooting them with 
Nerf guns or swords. The game goes on for at least a week, making class changes and trips to Slate a hazard for 
unprepared humans! Think you're a survivor? Register now, under "Register" above!

<span class=F3>Updates</span>
<br>
<br>
10/28/11 - Fixed a glitch where any kill entered between 12:00 AM and 12:59 AM was showing up as 12:-- PM.
<br>
<br>
10/12/2011 - There's now a "Lost Code" page. If you have lost your code, you can enter your email and it will send you your code. The link is on the Report page.
<br>
<br>
10/10/2011 - Added individualized "Fail Pages" for the reporting system. When a kill report fails, it now tells you 
what exactly went wrong. In addition, all kills must be reported within three days. Thanks to Zac Havens.
<br>
<br>
